        "body": "The battle over the future of the Internet is a power grab that pits well-heeled lobbyists, corrupt legislators, phony front groups and the world\u2019s most powerful telecommunications companies against the rest of us \u2014 the millions of Americans who use the Internet every day, in increasingly inventive ways.\r\n\r\nPolicymakers are public officials, and it\u2019s their job to serve the public interest. You can play an important role by helping spread the word about Net Neutrality, meeting face to face with elected officials and urging them to protect the open Internet.\r\n\r\nYou can start by urging the Senate to stand up for Net Neutrality.

        "body": "The human race is likely to be wiped out by a doomsday virus before the Millennium is out, unless we set up colonies in space, Prof Stephen Hawking warns today.\r\n\r\nIn an interview with The Telegraph, Prof Hawking, the world's best known cosmologist, says that biology, rather than physics, presents the biggest challenge to human survival.\r\n\r\n\"Although September 11 was horrible, it didn't threaten the survival of the human race, like nuclear weapons do,\" said the Cambridge University scientist.\r\n\r\n\"In the long term, I am more worried about biology. Nuclear weapons need large facilities, but genetic engineering can be done in a small lab. You can't regulate every lab in the world. The danger is that either by accident or design, we create a virus that destroys us.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet. But I'm an optimist. We will reach out to the stars.\"",
